# LeoFi - Staking Assistant

LeoFi is a staking assistant designed to work with Meta Pool, a multi-chain, Liquid-Staking Based Ecosystem. This project aims to simplify the staking process and provide users with an intuitive interface for managing their stakes across various blockchains.

## What is Meta Pool?

Meta Pool's objective is to provide easy and permissionless access to Web3 financial tools for everybody. It encompasses:

- **Vote-to-Earn**: An attractive DAO governance system that pays participants.
- **Liquid Staking Tokens**: Available on Ethereum, NEAR, Solana, Aurora, ICP, and Q.
- **Liquidity Pools**: Allowing everyone to become a liquidity provider.
- **Launchpad**: To help launch new projects with your staking rewards.
- **Bond Market**: For trading locked positions.

The Meta Pool DAO currently allows users to liquid-stake with the same simple and approachable interface across Ethereum, NEAR, Solana, and Aurora, with constant expansion to more blockchains.

## Features

- Easy-to-use interface for staking across multiple chains
